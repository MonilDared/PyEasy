# About Module
Hey This Is A Module For Python It Makes Python So Easy With Its Built-in Functions first do: `import pyeasy`
pyeasy has an alphs variable which has a list of alphabets
to import use: `pyeasy.alphs` and pyeasy also has a list of numbers which can be imported using: `pyeasy.numbs` the list of numbers is about 0 to 9 pyeasy also has a `renderText()` function which is different from `print()` you are thinking what is different from `print()` ? because this function has animated text it uses 2 args 1 is `string` 2 is `writetime` you can put `writetime` 0.1 to 0.10 now don't think more about `writetime`
put any number from this. then second function is `deleteText()` which will delete the `renderText()` you have written before it takes 1 arg wait which is how many seconds after it should delete the text thats the brief explaination of pyeasy.
